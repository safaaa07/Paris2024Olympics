# Paris 2024 Olympics Medals EDA
For all sports fans like myself, the last week (or so) after the end of the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics has felt a little empty! I took advantage of the fact that the event is still a hot topic to do some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the [Medals Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/paris-2024-olympics-medals/data). I kept it pretty simple, working only with Excel to create my charts and the final dashboard. This project was mainly aimed to push my analytical thinking to derive insights / discussions from this specific dataset, while working on my Excel skills.

## What's in this repository?
- The original csv file in the "original dataset" folder
- The Excel Workbook with all the visualizations and the dashboard in the "final workbook" folder
- The dashboard as a PDF file
- A report explaining the scope of my project, the steps taken and the insights derived

### Note
The Results and Interpretation section in the report is still being reviewed, if you have any suggestions on hhow to improve it!
